# Personal-Projects
This repository contains any relevant software design and coding projects that I have worked on during my tenure at Western University. Many of these were projects that included group work and collaboration. For inquiries regarding how these projects were designed and built, or to further understand my contribution please contact me via E-mail or phone number.
